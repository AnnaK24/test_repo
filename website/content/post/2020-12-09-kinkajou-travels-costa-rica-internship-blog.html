<p>In the fall semester of my junior year, I took part in an internship abroad with Kids Saving the Rainforest, a wildlife rescue, sanctuary, and conservation center in Quepos, Costa Rica. This fantastic study abroad experience taught me more than I could have imagined about conservation, animal care, Costa Rican history and culture, research, ecotourism and more. I maintained a blog documenting my experiences there, and while it is by no means comprehensive, it gives a good account of my time in Costa Rica. Feel free to take a look!</p>
